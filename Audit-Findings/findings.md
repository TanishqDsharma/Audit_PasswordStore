### [H-1] Passwords stored on-chain are visable to anyone, not matter solidity variable visibility

**Description:** All data stored on-chain is visible to anyone, and can be read directly from the blockchain. The `PasswordStore::s_password` variable is intended to be a private variable, and only accessed through the `PasswordStore::getPassword` function, which is intended to be only called by the owner of the contract. 

However, anyone can direclty read this using any number of off chain methodologies

**Impact:** The password is not private. 

**Proof of Concept:** The below test case shows how anyone could read the password directly from the blockchain. We use [foundry's cast](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) tool to read directly from the storage of the contract, without being the owner. 

1. Create a locally running chain
```bash
make anvil
```

2. Deploy the contract to the chain

```
make deploy 
```

3. Run the storage tool

We use `1` because that's the storage slot of `s_password` in the contract.

```
cast storage <ADDRESS_HERE> 1 --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545
```

You'll get an output that looks like this:

`0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014`

You can then parse that hex to a string with:

```
cast parse-bytes32-string 0x6d7950617373776f726400000000000000000000000000000000000000000014
```

And get an output of:

```
myPassword
```

**Recommended Mitigation:** Due to this, the overall architecture of the contract should be rethought. One could encrypt the password off-chain, and then store the encrypted password on-chain. This would require the user to remember another password off-chain to decrypt the password. However, you'd also likely want to remove the view function as you wouldn't want the user to accidentally send a transaction with the password that decrypts your password. 






### [S-#] `PasswordStore::setPassword` has no access control, meaning a non-owner can change the password

**Description:** The `PasswordStore::setPassword` function is set to be an `external` function, however the natspec of the function and overall purpose of smartcontract is that  `This function allows only owner to set a new password.`

```javascript
    function setPassword(string memory newPassword) external {
@>      // @audit - There are no access controls here
        s_password = newPassword;
        emit SetNetPassword();
    }
```

**Impact:** Anyone can set/change the password of the contract, severly breaking the contract intended functionality.

* Add the following to the test file:

```javascript
function test_anyone_can_set_password(address randomAddress) public {
    vm.prank(randomAddress);
    string memory expectedPassword = "myNewPassword";
    passwordStore.setPassword(expectedPassword);
    vm.prank(owner);
    string memory actualPassword = passwordStore.getPassword();
    assertEq(actualPassword, expectedPassword);
}
```

**Recommended Mitigations** Add an access control modifier to the `setPassword` function. 

```javascript
if (msg.sender != s_owner) {
    revert PasswordStore__NotOwner();
}
```
